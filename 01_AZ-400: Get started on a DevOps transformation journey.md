## Introduction to DevOps

- For DevOps transformations, the separate team should be composed of staff members. Focused on and measured on the transformation outcomes and not involved in the day-to-day operational work. The team might also include some external experts that can fill the knowledge gaps—also, helping to advise on processes that are new to the existing staff members.

- It is essential to have an ongoing series of short-term goals. Overall, projects should have timelines that span anywhere from a few months to a year or two in any DevOps transformation project.

- Not all staff members within an organization will be receptive to the change required for a DevOps transformation.
  In discussions around continuous delivery, we usually categorize users into three general buckets:

  - **Canary** users voluntarily test bleeding edge features as soon as they're available.
  - **Early adopters** who voluntarily preview releases, considered more refined than the code that exposes canary users.
  - **Users** who consume the products after passing through canary and early adopters.

When starting, it is essential to find an improvement goal that:

- It can be used to gain early wins.
- It is small enough to be achievable in a reasonable timeframe.
- Has benefits that are significant enough to be evident to the organization.
The aim is to build a snowball effect where each new successful outcome adds to previous successful results. It will maximize the buy-in from all affected.

- vertical team structures span the architecture and are aligned with skillsets or disciplines. Vertical teams have been shown to provide more good outcomes in Agile projects. Each product must have an identified owner.

- For a successful DevOps transformation, the aim is to find team members with the following characteristics:

    1. They already think there is a need to change.
    1. They have previously shown an ability to innovate.
    1. They are already well respected within the organization.
    1. They have a broad knowledge of the organization and how it operates.
    1. Ideally, they already believe that DevOps practices are what is needed.

There is more than one type of agile coach.

- Some coaches are technical experts who aim to show staff members how to apply specific concepts—for example, test-driven development and continuous integration or deployment.
  - These coaches might do peer programming sessions with staff members.
- Other coaches are focused on agile processes, determining requirements, and managing work activities.
  - They might help how to run effective stand-up and review meetings.
  - Some coaches may themselves act as scrum masters.
    - They might mentor staff in how to fill these roles.

### What is Azure DevOps?

Azure DevOps is a Software as a service (SaaS) platform from Microsoft that provides an end-to-end DevOps toolchain for developing and deploying software.
